1. What is the general audience that you would like to direct the educational materials to?
Primary audience is people uninformed about birds, of all ages.

2. If there are multiple audiences (i.e. ranchers, students, etc), which would you prefer to be the focus of the project?
N/A

3. Where do you plan to display these materials?
Mostly at places like booths.

4. What situations would you like to use these materials for (i.e. on-the-go, in a private presentation, as a booth item)?
Booth.

5. Would you like to have students be able to interact with the materials or would you rather have a presenter use them?
Interactivity seems to be important (to differentiate from the static display).

6. Does a single webpage containing information and javascript elements sound interesting to you?
Idea: setting (background) with birds you can click on and see more information about them. 

      6.5  Would you like to see references to other sources of information or focus strictly on your name and company?
      
7. On what medium do you want to present the display? (tablet, computer and mouse, touchscreen computer, phone)
See #9.

8. Are you more concerned about presenting something that's aesthetically pleasing and interactive, or informative? Or a mix?


9. As far as format goes, are there any specific mediums that you want this presentation in?
Don't be too flashy (they are non-profit). Mentioned that a dynamic display (such as a tablet) would be a cool and cheap option.
Something like a slideshow with some sort of interactivity. Audio is important.
