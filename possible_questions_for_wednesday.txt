What is the general audience that you would like to direct the educational materials to?
  If there are multiple audiences (i.e. ranchers, students, etc), which would you prefer to be the focus of the project?
Where do you plan to display these materials?
What situations would you like to use these materials for (i.e. on-the-go, in a private presentation, as a booth item)?
Would you like to have students be able to interact with the materials or would you rather have a presenter use them?
