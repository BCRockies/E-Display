		<p>Did you know that, out of all the possible organisms in the world, birds are the leading indicators of environmental change? When most people think of birds, they don’t consider much than their aesthetic features—which makes sense, as they are a wonderful part of our natural world.</p>

		<br>

		<p>Another little-known fact is that a lot of these species are in trouble and require help before they go extinct. RMBO's biologists, educators and natural resource managers work on solutions for bird and habitat conservation through a full-circle approach of Science, Education and Stewardship. Our mission is to address a need for bird conservation and to spread public education about our cause! We pursue this mission in collaboration with partners in the Rocky Mountains, the Great Plains, Mexico and beyond.</p>
